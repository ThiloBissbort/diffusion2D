# diffusion2D
A little tool to play around with chemical diffusion in 2D space. You are able to create up to 3 compositional zones of different width. Diffusion rates can be set differently for two directions (anisotropy). Profiles along x and y are plotted while their location can be changed. For now the input is dimensionless - however the program can be used for demonstration purposes e.g., how the placement of profiles can be prone to "cutting effects" of diffused zoning.
