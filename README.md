# diffusion2D
A little tool to play around with chemical diffusion in 2D space. You are able to create up to 3 compositional zones of different width. Diffusion rates can be set differently for two directions (anisotropy). Profiles along x and y are plotted while their location can be changed. No "real" quantities are used, but this can be easily changed in the code by the user.
